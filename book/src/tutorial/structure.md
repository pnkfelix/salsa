# Basic structure

Before we do anything with Salsa, let's talk about the basic structure of the calc compiler.
Part of Salsa's design is that you are able to write programs that feel 'pretty close' to what a natural Rust program looks like.

## Example program

This is our example calc program:

```
x = 5
y = 10
z = x + y * 3
print z
```

## Parser

The calc compiler takes as input a program, represented by a string:

```rust
struct ProgramSource {
    text: String
}
```

The first thing it does it to parse that string into a series of statements that look something like the following pseudo-Rust:[^lexer]

```rust
enum Statement {
    /// Defines `fn <name>(<args>) = <body>`
    Function(Function),
    /// Defines `print <expr>`
    Print(Expression),
}

/// Defines `fn <name>(<args>) = <body>`
struct Function {
    name: FunctionId,
    args: Vec<VariableId>,
    body: Expression
}
```

where an expression is something like this (pseudo-Rust, because the `Expression` enum is recursive):

```rust
enum Expression {
    Op(Expression, Op, Expression),
    Number(f64),
    Variable(VariableId),
    Call(FunctionId, Vec<Expression>),
}

enum Op {
    Add,
    Subtract,
    Multiply,
    Divide,
}
```

Finally, for function/variable names, the `FunctionId` and `VariableId` types will be interned strings:

```rust
type FunctionId = /* interned string */;
type VariableId = /* interned string */;
```

[^lexer]: Because calc is so simple, we don't have to bother separating out the lexer from the parser.

## Checker

The "checker" has the job of ensuring that the user only references variables that have been defined.
We're going to write the checker in a "context-less" style,
which is a bit less intuitive but allows for more incremental re-use.
The idea is to compute, for a given expression, which variables it references.
Then there is a function `check` which ensures that those variables are a subset of those that are already defined.

## Evaluator

The evaluator will execute the program and print the result.
Mostly for demonstration purposes, we have set it up so that
it will avoid re-executing functions if their body has not changed.
